            <p>
                <p>Track is a really cool sport that I do that is often overlooked or looked down upon. Since there's no "main goal" in track besides PR'ing and winning races, it's often seen as pointless and hard and boring. 
                    But there are many things in track that make it a lot of fun. Track is a sport that contains multiple events, so if one thing isn't really "your thing" it's easy to go try something else. 
                    It's really cool. Especially if you aren't built for running, then you can do 
                    Shot Put, Javelin or Discus instead. 
                     I'll crack down on each event in this order, </p><ol>

          <p> <h2>100m</h2>
        The 100 meter dash is the shortest event that you can do in track. It's an event for sprinters. You'll stand at the line and just blast at full speed through the straight and hope your faster than everyone else. 
        This event doesn't require anything, but if you're serious, maybe a pair of sprinting spikes to help you out a bit. They can help you with grip and with more grip, you gain more speed and in track, speed is everything when it comes to the 100m.
        If you're looking for a pair of sprinting spikes.
        When you're sprinting anything can affect how fast you go and if your form is good, until the end and you throw up your hands at the finish, you may just lose your lead. It's important to maintain, if not speed up, your speed at the end of the race because that's one of the most important times in a race. 
           
        <h2>200m</h2>
        The 200m is a real fun run. (I'm being sarcastic, I hate 200's but you might like it) You run the curve on the the track and then the straight. Running the curve is annoying for me, I don't like it, but I have some friends who are real good at 200's and enjoy it, kudos to them.
        This is another sprint event for my sprinters out there, it isn't really blunt speed, there's a bit of skill involved, if you can maintain a really fast pace througout the whole thing, good for you, if you can't then you might try pushing 75% on the curve, and then 
        pushing 100% on the straight and of course 1,000% at the finish. Equipment includes sprinting spikes. 

        <h2>400m</h2>
        The 400m is the last event that is considered a "sprinting event". (It's also considered a middle distance event) It is one full lap around the track as fast as you possibly can. This one you have to be careful. If you start too fast you may sustain your lead until halfway depending on your endurance. 
        On the other hand, if you go too slow at the beginning (and this goes for a lot of events) it's really hard to catch up. Sprinting spikes are reccomended because this is still a sprinting event. The 4 is a lot of fun to run, but you have to be willing to put your all into it,
        this ain't no warmup run. 
        
        <h2>800m</h2>
        The 800m is considered a "middle distance" event. That means that it's not a sprint, but it's not really a distance event either because distance events are anything over the mile. The 800m is 2 laps around the track. It is important to establish pace when you're racing long(er) so that
        way you don't get too tired too fast, but you're still gaining enough ground to keep your position. Equipment for this one, is like middle distance spikes. Not much else. Just endurance and spikes. 
        <h2>1600m</h2>
        The 1600m is a distance run that is 4 laps around the track. It's a mile, and is really easy for some of my friends. Some people are built for it, others are not. It's ok if you're not a mile runner, the people who are gonna run the 1600m are people that do XC, cuz it's just their life 
        and they love putting in the miles. Some people may look like they're naturally good at it, but they took time to get there. Anyway, equipment for this is distance spikes. At the bottom, with all the links, is an explination as to what the difference is between the different kinds of spikes.
        <h2>3200m</h2>
        The 3200 is another distance event for my XC people, (and if you're not an XC person, and you're running this, you should be) this is the basically 2-mile run. It's the longest distance run for highschool track. It's 8 laps around the track & the amount of endurance you've gotta have is a lot. 
        Kudos to anyone who runs this one, you're a real adrenaline junkie. This one you have to maintain a pace for (if you're fast, 10 minutes) anywhere from 10-20 minutes depending on your speed. Distance spikes for this one too.

        <h2>Discus</h2>
        This whole next section is just throwing things. 
        A discus is a metal frisbee that's built smaller, heavier and more dangerously. You need to be careful when you're throwing these things. 
        You also have to make sure that when you throw it, you're throwing it correctly, I'll attach videos to help. 
        <h2>Hammer Throw</h2>

        <h2>Shot Put</h2>
        Have you ever just wanted to throw a metal ball? 
        That's basically all shot put is. It is just throwing a heavy metal ball as far as you can. (NOT AT PEOPLE!!) It's actually kinda fun. With this you have to be careful because if not, then you can hurt yourself. Your coaches should teach you how to throw it properly or I'll attatch a few
        links here to help you. Reccomended spikes are field/throwing spikes.
